# UnityTerrainGrass

Drop-in replacement terrain grass shader for Unity.

# How to use

Should work in Unity 4 and up, until they update the terrain system one day. Probably works in Unity 3 as well.

- Make some built-in Unity terrain with grass.
- Drop the two shaders anywhere in your Assets folder. They'll automatically override the hidden default ones.
- Press the Refresh button on the grass placing screen.
